What am I looking at?
> Create your own superhero team from the available Marvel API characters! Teams are saved via Firestore.

What platform does this program run on?
> This is an Android app programmed in Java.

How do I run this app?
> Provided are the Java and XML files extracted from an Android Studio build. Create a project on Android Studio and paste the code into the project manually.

> To get your own keys, go to https://developer.marvel.com/ and create an account. The code itself omits the keys so you would need to paste it in yourself into MainActivity.java.
